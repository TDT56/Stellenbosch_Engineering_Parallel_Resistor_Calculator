# Stellenbosch_Engineering_Parallel_Resistor_Calculator
This was created to calculate which two parallel resistors will give a required value

This program finds the best resistor pair in parallel to obtain a certain value.
0.5 O being the minimum and 410 kO being the maximum 

add a small letter k for kilo ohm as in 256k (without any spaces)
111 and 111k could results in a different resistor pair because it is based on the actual resistors in the lab

the program also allows for overshoot because it is not possible to obtain the exact value
thus is you input 256 you may get a answer (like 256.75) slighty higher
if you wish to never get overshoot just set the overshoot variable below to zero

ENJOY!
